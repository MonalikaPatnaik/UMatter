3. Issues will be assigned on a **first-come, first-serve basis.**
4. Participants/contributors can also **open their issues** using issue_template,
but it needs to be verified and labeled by a mentor or PA. Please discuss this with the team once before opening your issues. We respect all your contributions, whether 
it is an Issue or a Pull Request.
