2. Participants/contributors have to **comment** on issues they would like to work on, and mentors or the PA will assign you.
3. Issues will be assigned on a **first-come, first-serve basis.**
4. Participants/contributors can also **open their issues** using issue_template,
but it needs to be verified and labeled by a mentor or PA. Please discuss this with the team once before opening your issues. We respect all your contributions, whether 
it is an Issue or a Pull Request.
6. When you raise an issue, make sure you get it assigned to you before you start working on that project.
7. Each participant/contributor will be **assigned 1 issue (max)** at a time to work.
8. Participants are expected to follow **project guidelines** and **coding style** . **Structured code** is one of our top priorities.

12. Make sure you **discuss issues** before working on the issue.
13. Pull requests will be merged after being **reviewed** by a mentor or PA.
